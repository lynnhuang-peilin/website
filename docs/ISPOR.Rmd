# ISPOR Student Network

All ISPOR members who are students belong to the Student Network---an engaged collection of PhD, masters, PharmD, and other HEOR-related disciplines. With 1000+ individual members and 2000 chapter members from around the world, the Student Network represents more than 70 countries.

The Network's students are united by similar interests and passion for excellence in research. Most student members belong to a local chapter based at, or near, their university. Currently there are more than 140 ISPOR Student Chapters representing 30+ countries.

The ISPOR Student Network also provides for leadership opportunities in the form of volunteer roles: student network chair, 4 student committees, 3 regional leads, and the student internship/fellowship subcommittee of the Faculty Advisor Council's Professional Development Focus Group.
